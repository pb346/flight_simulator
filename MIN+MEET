purpose: Start gitRepo. Download required software. Discuss how to tackle the project

Progress: We have an idea how to implement some of the mathmatical formulas. We had an issue figuring out how to display the angular orientation in a plane in 2D. It was suggested to use openGL to create a sphere to show current angular orientation. Discussed future stages of the project.
